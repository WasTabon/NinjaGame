  tutorialSteps:
  - In this game, your goal is to explore mazes and collect magic orbs.
  - There are 3 orbs in total on each level. If you collect them all, you move on
    to the next level. If you miss even one, you lose and must start over.
  - Each level has several mazes, but you only get a limited number of keys. The
    number of keys is always smaller than the number of mazes.
  - "To enter a maze, you need a key with the same number as the maze\u2019s number.
    For example, if a maze has the number 3, you need a key with the number 3."
  - "If the numbers don\u2019t match, you can change the number on your key using
    runes. You get 2 runes per level, and each rune can increase or decrease a key\u2019s
    number by 1."
  - "Be careful! If you use your last key to open the wrong maze and the orbs are
    hidden elsewhere, you\u2019ll lose the game."
  - Along the way, you can also find coins inside the mazes. Use them to upgrade
    your home.
  - "Choose your paths wisely \u2014 one wrong key can cost you everything."
